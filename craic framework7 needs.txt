Index: 
	Indivuduals: after login with facebook, logoutPerson() function from app.js file is not working.
	It should close de session and come back to the index. (Hight Priority)

	Put the login bottom on the views business and individual. (Medium priority)
	
	Information of individual, business and info needs to be fill. (Low priority) 
	
Login page: 

	For existing Business users, login needs a bottom or sign in bigger and call a function to validate the access.
	for this we have to create the php file to connect with the data base and give or deny access. 
	In this step we have to create a session to keep trace of the business id. (Tong/Andres) (Hight Priority) 

	For new business, the option "Create account" needs to call the create business page or view. I put the code on 
	/bussRegister.html but this have to be a view named different and in another frame. (Hight priority)
	we need to include web address and eircode field, Lat, Long and url for the logo. This last 3 are low priority.

Dashboards.	
	After a login or a new business registration, the site must open a Business Dashboard (It is not implemented)
	(Medium priority)
	
	Create a new craic, must be on the "Daily Event" view. 	the code is on the file /bussDash.
	
	After run a php file for create a business or new craic, the page stay blank and doesn't return to the html call. 
	I was checking codes but maybe we need to use Ajax or functions in js for the calls instead of calling from html to php.
